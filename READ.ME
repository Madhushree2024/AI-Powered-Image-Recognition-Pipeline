# AI-Powered Image Recognition Pipeline

An event-driven, serverless pipeline built on AWS that automatically detects objects in uploaded images using machine learning.

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a cloud-native architecture for real-time image processing. When a user uploads an image to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function is automatically triggered. This function interacts with AWS Rekognition to extract labels (objects, scenes, and concepts) and stores the metadata in a DynamoDB table.

### Key Features
* **Event-Driven:** Uses S3 Event Notifications to eliminate manual triggers.
* **AI Integration:** Leverages AWS Rekognition (Computer Vision) for high-accuracy object detection.
* **Sub-second Latency:** Optimized for fast execution, completing the end-to-end flow in < 1 second.
* **Serverless:** Scalable and cost-effective; no servers to manage.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1.  **Storage:** Amazon S3 (Input Bucket)
2.  **Compute:** AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
3.  **Intelligence:** AWS Rekognition (DetectLabels API)
4.  **Database:** Amazon DynamoDB (Metadata Storage)
5.  **Monitoring:** Amazon CloudWatch (Logging & Performance)

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Cloud Provider:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Library:** Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)

## 📖 How it Works
1.  An image is uploaded to the designated **S3 Bucket**.
2.  An **S3:ObjectCreated** event triggers the **Lambda function**.
3.  The Lambda function extracts the bucket name and object key.
4.  The function sends the image to **AWS Rekognition**.
5.  Detected labels with a confidence score > 80% are parsed.
6.  The image name and its corresponding labels are saved into **DynamoDB**.

## 📊 Performance Monitoring
Using **Amazon CloudWatch**, I monitored the performance of the pipeline.
* **Average Execution Time:** ~450ms - 700ms
* **Memory Footprint:** ~60MB - 80MB
* **Success Rate:** 100% (based on test image sets)
